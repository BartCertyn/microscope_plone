                            <li>We recommend booking the LSM 780 or LSM 880 instead of this older version.</li>
                            <!-- can always put this back on 
                            <li>The Zeiss LSM 510 has been moved to the room next door (still in microscopy unit). Please be aware that you cannot view blue
                                fluorescent probes anymore on this system.  A new LSM 880 - Airyscan will be available as from week 13/02, which is the system of 
                                preference for your current confocal imaging work. Users of the LSM 510 or LSM 780 will soon be invited for an update to get used 
                                to using LSM 880.
                            </li>
                            <li>Zeiss LSM 510 will be moved: week 06-10 February 2017    A new LSM 880 - Airyscan will be installed during the same week.</li>
                            <li>March 2nd 2016:  The LSM510 has been moved to the right hand side of the curtain (still in the same room). All lasers have been realigned and a full maintenance performed. It's fully functional again w/o any error message.</li>
                            <li>July 2015:  The new 40x lens got damaged again in a similar way as last time. Somebody should remember to have dropped something heavy and metallic onto the casing of the lens. Please be extremely careful when handling the lenses ! Their quality is crucial to everyones experiments.</li>
                            <li>The microscope computer has been migrated to LUNA. This means from now (August 27th) on you have to login with your LUNA account (psswd for E-mail, KULoket, etc....). Since you will be considered to be a new user, you have to run the 'LSM510toZEN update' file before you start the ZEN software. Double click on this file and click "YES and OK" to continue. Then start the programme "ZEN 2009". </li>
                            <li>New training on September 12th.</li>
                            <li>June 19-20th: training sessions from ZEISS.</li>
                            <li>February 15th 2014: The new PC with new ZEN software is active.  The first time you use the system in its new location, you should run the 'LSM510toZEN update' file which you will find on the desktop after you've logged in. Double click on this file and click "YES and OK" to continue. Then start the programme "ZEN 2009". Although the interface looks different, the programme is exactly the same, you can reuse your previously recorded files exactly the way you did before. Good luck.</li>
                            <li>A training session to get familiar with the new software will be organised soon by ZEISS on February 27th and 28th. Existing users will be invited by mail and can participate free of charge.</li>
                            <li>During the last months of use in 2013, the 40x lens got badly damaged because someone dropped something metallic and heavy on the lens. Please be extremely careful when handling the lenses ! Their quality is crucial to everyones experiments. The lens is being repaired.</li>
                            <li>February 1st 2014: The new PC with new ZEN software is being fixed by ZEISS. In the meantime the previous software is available on the system.</li>
                            <li>Dear all, the LSM 510 microscope has been moved O&N1, 7th floor room 505 (entrance via 07.469).  The microscope is again fully operational, lasers aligned and cleaned. Please keep it clean. Oil should only be used on the 40 and 63x lens. A new software (ZEN) package has been installed, which may appear different, but is the same in principle. Images from previous recordings can be reused.</li>
                            <li>You will have to bring your badge (personnel card) to enter the microscopy unit.</li>

                            <li>23rd December 2013 - January 14th 2014 : The microscope will be unavailable until January 15th. During this time the microscope will be upgraded, updated and moved to O&N1, 7th floor (07.469). From January onwards the Zeiss LSM 510 will be available again in the new facility together with other fluorescence, spinning disk confocal and Zeiss LSM 780 NLO microscopes. You will need to badge when you're entering the microscopy unit.</li>
                            <li>October - December 2013: Full maintenance of the LSM 510 has been postponed until January 2013 because the multiphoton microscope will be moved the first half of January to the new CIC facility in O&N 1, 7th floor. Due to refurbishments on the 10th floor, operation and accessibility of the microscope may be suboptimal. </li>
                            <li>June 4th 2013: new mercury lamp installed and aligned.</li>
                            <li>May 8th 2013: computer screen problems are solved. You can use 2 screens again.</li>
                            <li>May 7th 2013: unfortunately the problem with the screen is not related to the screen itself but to the videocard. We are working on a solution. In the meantime it is best to just use one screen.</li>
                            <li>April 18th 2013: One computer screen is disabled because it mal functions. Please use one screen untill the problem is solved.</li>

                <h2>Technical Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The LSM 510 confocal microscope consits of an inverted Axiovert 200M body for imaging fixed samples and living cells in culture dishes. 
                    The microscope has high numerical aperture (NA) lenses (Plan-Neofluar 10x/0.3, Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.3 Oil DIC, C-achroplan NIR 40x/0.8 W 
                    and Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC), a confocal scanhead (Zeiss LSM510) to select one optical plane at a certain depth in the specimen and 
                    make images void of background. As excitation light sources, a set of three lasers: one Argon (458, 477, 488, 514 nm) and two HeNe lasers (543, 633 nm) 
                    are in place - which fully cover the whole spectrum of excitation needed for the most commonly used fluorophores. The system is equipped with sensitive
                    photomultiplier tubes (PMT) and a META detector system that enables the researcher to perform spectral un-mixing in case 2 or more fluorescent probes with 
                    overlapping spectra are required for the experiment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Apart from the two microscopes, the facility also has a laminar air flow (LAF) for preparation of cells under sterile conditions, 
                    a CO2 incubator for short-term cell culture and a cell-perfusion system that allows users to switch solutions or administer drugs during
                    live-cell-image recordings. The unit is set up to be a multi-user facility, which also offers the advantage that there is expertise around 
                    in many applications of fluorescent imaging, including calcium imaging with a variety of sensors, imaging of eGFP (and its mutants), FRAP and multi-color
                    immunocytochemistry.
